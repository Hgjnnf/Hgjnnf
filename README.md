## Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub profile üëã

### About Me

- My name is Gordon. I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering at the University of British Columbia. ‚ö°Ô∏è
- I am interested in solving business problems and build for people by leveraging the power of technology. üíº 
- Right now, my focus is in full-stack web development, and I am learning about relational databases. üñ•Ô∏è
- As an EE major, I also have an interest in firmware and digital circuit design. ‚öôÔ∏è

#### Experience
- I have done an 8-month co-op @ Samsung Electronics working on enterprise software on the frontend side. 
- I am also involved with UBC Launch Pad and UBC Product Management Club as a developer because I love building for and collaborating with the community I care about. 
- I've also built a few personal projects which you may find on my GitHub (more is on the way!).
